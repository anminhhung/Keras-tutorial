For this reason, the first layer in a Sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape. There are several possible ways to do this:  \n","* Pass an input_shape argument to the first layer. This is a shape tuple (a tuple of integers or None entries, where None indicates that any positive integer may be expected). In input_shape, the batch dimension is not included.  \n","* Some 2D layers, such as Dense, support the specification of their input shape via the argument input_dim, and some 3D temporal layers support the arguments input_dim and input_length.  \n","* If you ever need to specify a fixed batch size for your inputs (this is useful for stateful recurrent networks), you can pass a batch_size argument to a layer. If you pass both batch_size=32 and input_shape=(6, 8) to a layer, it will then expect every batch of inputs to have the batch shape (32, 6, 8).  \n","\n","As such, the following snippets are strictly equivalent:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Si2x3oG3Z1r-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["model = Sequential()\n","model.add(Dense(32, input_shape=(784, )))\n","\n","model = Sequential()\n","model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=784))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wySl3n8IaZK0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Compilation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wP4FvGEaamVW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Before training a model, you need to configure the learning process, which is done via the compile method.
